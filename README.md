# knight-rider-with-20-leds
This is a knight rider pattern I did with 20 LEDs (16 of them being normal red LEDs and 4 of them being weird cubic LEDs)


This took me about an hour with the wiring and figuring out the gpio pin numbers on my rpi 4B, but luckily it all worked first try.

I used 20 LEDs, 21 male-female cables, a 390 ohm resistor and an rpi 4b for this project.
